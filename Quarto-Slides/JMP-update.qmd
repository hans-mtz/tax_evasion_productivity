## Outline

- Does the empirical results and identification depend on the linearity of the PF?
- Who are the compliers, the small firms or the big firms?
- Size defined by what measure?

## Preview

- Tax evasion estimates using a CD PF might be a lower bound if the derivative of the true PF is monotonic in $m^*$
- Even though very big firms do not overreport inputs, they might be very few to statistically learn from them
- Alternatively, using small firms might provide lower bound of tax evasion because they do not evade as much as large firms


## Departing from CD

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \mathbb{E}\left[\ln\left(\frac{\rho M^*}{PY}\right)\right] &= \mathbb{E}\left[\ln\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial m^*}f(k_{it},l_{it},m_{it}^*+\varepsilon_{it}^M)\right)\right]+\ln\mathcal{E}+\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon_{it}^M] \\
  &= \mathbb{E}\left[\ln\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial m^*}f(k_{it},l_{it},m_{it}^*)\right)\right]+\delta+\ln\mathcal{E}+\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon_{it}^M]
\end{aligned}
$$

where, $\delta\equiv\mathbb{E}\left[\ln\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial m^*}f(k_{it},l_{it},m_{it}^*+\varepsilon_{it}^M)\right)\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[\ln\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial m^*}f(k_{it},l_{it},m_{it}^*)\right)\right]$

## Departing from CD

- $\frac{\partial }{\partial m^*}f(\cdot)$ can still be recovered from compliers

- $\delta\ge0$ if $\frac{\partial }{\partial m^*}f(k_{it},l_{it},m_{it}^*+\varepsilon_{it}^M)$ is monotonic in $m_{it}^*+\varepsilon_{it}^M$

- $\delta$ is a function of $\varepsilon^M_{it}$ and therefore not independent from $\mathbb{E}\left[\ln\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial m^*}f(\cdot)\right)\right]$

## CD as a lower bound

- CD PF ignores the non-linear effect $\delta$, however it can be considered a lower bound

- The tax evasion may be greater than what CD suggests because $\delta\ge0$

- Alternatively, because $m^*_{it}$ is not observed separately from $\varepsilon_{it}^M$, using a PF with a derivative that is monotonic in $m_{it}^*+\varepsilon_{it}^M$ might affect estimates of tax evasion


## Translog PF 

In the case of the translog PF when there is only $K$ and $M$

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \mathbb{E}\left[\ln\left(\frac{\rho M^*}{PY}\right)\right]=\mathbb{E}&\left[\ln\left(\beta_0 +\beta_K\ln K+\beta_M \ln M^*+\beta_M\varepsilon_{it}^M\right)\right]\\
  &+\ln\mathcal{E}+\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon_{it}^M]
\end{aligned}
$$

## How to estimate?

Hu et al. (*J. Econom.* 2022)

$$
\begin{aligned}
  Y &= m_0(X^*) + \eta\\
  X &= X^* + \varepsilon
\end{aligned}
$$

- Zero conditional mean $\mathbb{E}[\eta|X^*]=0$
- Independence $f_{Y|X^*,X}(y|x^*,x)=f_{Y|X^*}(y|x^*)$
- Normalization $G[f_{X|X^*}(\cdot|x^*)]=x^*$
- Monotonicity $m_0$ is strictly monotonic in $X^*$
- Then, $m_0$ is identified even when $X^*$ and $\varepsilon$ are correlated

## Who are the compliers? 

- **Very big firms** do not evade taxes by overreporting inputs; more sophisticated, 
  - e.g., profit shifting, they can afford long legal disputes with authority to avoid paying taxes
  - Ecuadorian evidence: The probability of having ownership of a ghost client increases with individuals' income
  - Stronger incentives to avoid illegal behavior

## Who are the compliers?
  
- **Large firms** evade more through overreporting
  - Ghost clients have higher revenues, costs, and tax liabilities. 
  - The probability of engaging in cost overreporting increases monotonically in firm revenue [Higher volume of transactions. Fake invoicing limits to cash transactions. Cash transactions are capped in Ecuador.]{.small}
  - Share of ghost deductions also increases throughout much of the size distribution, except at the very top

## Who are the compliers?

- **Small firms** evade by overreporting but by a small amount
  - Small firms are less sophisticated (owner's income)
  - Small firms have a lower volume of transactions, so higher probability of getting caught if they cheat, so they cheat but a little

## Who are the compliers?

- It is still likely that very large firms do not overreport costs but they might be very few to statistically learn from them

- Alternatively, using small firms to learn about tax evasion can provide a lower bound of tax evasion


## Empirical evidence

Empirical model

$$
\begin{aligned}
s_{it}&=\beta_0+\beta_1D(Compliers)+\gamma_J+\varepsilon_{it}^Y\\
s_{it}&=\beta_0+\Phi(k,l,m)+\beta_1D(Compliers)+\gamma_J+\varepsilon_{it}^Y
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-ols}

- $D(Compliers)$: dummy variable, 1 if the firm is a complier; 0, otherwise
- $\gamma_J$: industry fixed effects
- $\Phi(\cdot)$: second degree polynomial

## Empirical evidence

Graphs report percentage deviations of compliers from the rest of the firms, controlling for industry

$\Delta\%=exp(\beta_1)-1$. Why?

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ln\beta_{Compliers}&=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1\\
&=\ln\beta_{Evaders}+\ln\Delta\\
&=\ln(\beta_{Evaders}\times\Delta)\\
\implies \Delta &=\frac{\beta_{Compliers}}{\beta_{Evaders}}\\
\implies exp(\hat{\beta_1})-1&=\frac{\beta_{Compliers}}{\beta_{Evaders}}-1\\
&\equiv \Delta \%
\end{aligned}
$$

## Summary

- CD functional form suggests Tax Evasion lower bound
- If very large firms are too few, I might use small firms knowing they cheat a little
- Maybe I won't be able to pick a measure of size until I get access to validation data

## Next steps

- Compliers: explore exporters (sophisticated), ISO certified firms (third-party reporting)
- Repeat exercise with Ecuadorian data
- Move forward to deconvolution for CD and Hu et al.(2023) for NLPF

## Update {.scrollable}

- Identification does not depend on functional form, i.e., CD
  - Show theory
  - Show Translog
  - Use deconvolution for CD and Hu et al. (2022) for non-parametric
- Maybe not able to use very large firms because they are very few. Even though it is true they are more sophisticated and they do not overreport costs, from a statistical perspective I can't learn too much from them
- Use small firms as lower bound estimates. They cheat, but they cheat a little. Small firms are:
  - Less sophisticated -> Higher income owners are more likely to have firms engaging in cost overreporting
  - Lower probability due to the lower number of transactions -> ghost transactions are caped at the threshold to avoid being forced into e-transfer (cash)
- Pending update in the paper:
  - Estimate tax evasion at the firm level Hu et al. (2022)
  - Show tax evasion effect in misallocation framework

## JMP update

- Ecuadorian Tax data:
  - Agustin Carvajal, a former member of Ecuador's Fiscal Research Institute (now extinct), is willing to provide access to data
  - **Data can only be accessed in Ecuador**
  - Paul Carrillo, author of Tax Evasion paper, agreed to talk
- Ecuadorian firm data:
  - Now using *Manufacturing and Mining Survey* (EMM), which includes small, medium, and large firms [before, *Structural Survey* only covers large firms]{.small}
  - Still fewer observations than Colombian data [(Colombia's manufacturing GDP is 2.5+ times bigger than Ecuador's)]{.small}


## Measure of firm size

Who are the non-evaders? What's the threshold of size?

- Data:
  - Last time: $exp\left(E\left[\ln\left(\frac{\rho M}{PY}\right)\Big | S\ge s\right]\right)=\beta$
  - Today: adding confidence intervals, keeping labor and capital, adding alternative measures of size [lag of paid taxes, sales, and production]{.small}
  
- Ecuador paper: eye-balling ~95-98 percentile of firm revenue

## Summary

- Using Labor (number of employees, and number of employees $x$ years, and somewhat less total wages) as measure of firm size is consisten with my model
- Different bias magnitude for different industries suggest different opportunities for tax evasion through cost overreporting --- which makes sense!
- High $\beta$'s for top deciles of lag taxes, lag output, and lag sales suggest there might be a dynamic component in tax evasion
  - Firms might adjust their prior probabilities the next period. If they were not caught cheating, they might cheat again

## Next steps

- Repeat the exercise with Ecuadorian data
- Select industries in both countries
- Deconvolution using Labor as the measure of firm size
  - Colombia
  - Ecuador
- Model?
  - Structural model counterfactual estimation for showcasing in JM
