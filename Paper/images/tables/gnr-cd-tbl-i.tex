% Estimates of Cobb-Douglas Production Functions using GNR(2020) for different definitions of intermediates. *mse* stands for raw materials, services, and energy; *materials* for raw materials; and *deductibles* for raw materials, electricity, fuels, and repair and maintenance services. Observations were trimmed to remove zeros that were biasing the residual estimates. The trimming was done by removing observations where the intermediate share was below 0.01, 0.03, or 0.05.
