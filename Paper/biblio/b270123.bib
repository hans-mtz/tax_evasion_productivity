   abstract = {Reducing tax evasion is a priority for many governments. A growing literature argues that verifying taxpayer reports against third-party information is critical for tax collection. However, effectiveness can be limited when tax authorities face constraints to credible enforcement and taxpayers make offsetting adjustments on other margins. We exploit a policy intervention in which Ecuadorian firms were notified about detected revenue discrepancies. Most firms simply failed to respond. Firms that responded increased reported revenue, matching the discrepancy amount when provided. However, they also increased reported costs by 96 cents per dollar of revenue adjustment, resulting in minor increases in tax collection. (JEL D22, H25, H26, O23) T ax evasion limits the development of fiscal capacity (Besley and Persson 2013), distorts the allocation of resources in the economy (Skinner and Slemrod 1985), and can result in a reliance on economically inefficient tax instruments (Gordon and Li 2009, Best et al. 2015). A recent literature has shifted emphasis from the traditional idea of tax enforcement through auditing (Allingham and Sandmo 1972) toward a focus on " third-party information:" the ability to verify taxpayer reports against other sources, such as employer reports of salary or reports by firms' trading partners (e.g., Kopczuk and Slemrod 2006, Kleven et al. 2011, and Pomeranz 2015). Third-party information is central to modern tax collection in developed countries (Kleven, Kreiner, and Saez 2016), and the global revolution in information technology has made its application easier than ever before. 1 Improvements in third-party 1 Recent years have seen widespread adoption of electronic tax filing and computerization of tax records (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 2011). Of the World Bank projects with a major tax or customs administration component in the 1990s, over 75 percent included computerization of taxes and customs (World Bank 2012).},
