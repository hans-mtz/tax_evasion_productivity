   abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects of size-dependent tax enforcement on firms' tax compliance. We exploit quasi-experimental variation generated by a Large Taxpayers Unit (LTU) in Spain, which monitors firms with more than €6 million in reported revenue. Firms strategically bunch below the eligibility threshold in order to avoid stricter tax enforcement. The response is stronger in sectors where transactions leave more paper trail, suggesting that monitoring effort and the traceability of information reported by firms are complements. We estimate that there would be substantial welfare gains from extending stricter tax monitoring to smaller businesses. (JEL H25, H26, H32, L25) I n recent decades, many tax administrations have established special units to monitor and improve the tax compliance of the largest taxpayers, following the advice of multilateral organizations such as the IMF and the OECD (Benon, Baer, and Toro 2002, CTPA 2011). The expected benefits from establishing Large Taxpayers Units (LTUs) include the ability to raise higher tax revenues and, more generally, increasing the efficiency of tax administration. Despite the widespread adoption of this size-dependent tax enforcement strategy around the world, there is very little micro-level evidence of the effects of LTUs on firm behavior. Moreover, we are not aware of any existing empirical research that evaluates the welfare effects of size-dependent tax enforcement. In this paper, we study the effects of size-dependent tax enforcement on firms' tax compliance and the welfare implications of this policy. In particular, we analyze how firms respond to the increased monitoring effort created by the eligibility).
