For the first time we develop a time series of tax evasion (in % of official GDP) for 38 OECD countries over the period 1999 to 2010 based on MIMIC model estimations of the shadow economy. Considering indirect taxation and self-employment as the driving forces of tax evasion, we observe a declining trend of tax evasion between 1999 and 2010 for all countries. The average size of tax evasion across all 38 countries over the period 1999 to 2010 is 3.2% of official GDP. The country with the highest average value is Mexico with 6.8%, followed by Turkey with 6.7%; at the lower end we find the United States and Luxembourg with 0.5% and 1.3%, respectively.   Keywords.

   abstract = {This paper investigates the sensitivity of hedonic models of house prices to the spatial interpolation of measures of air quality. We consider three aspects of this question: the interpolation technique used, the inclusion of air quality as a continuous vs discrete variable in the model, and the estimation method. Using a sample of 115,732 individual house sales for 1999 in the South Coast Air Quality Management District of Southern California, we compare Thiessen polygons, inverse distance weighting, Kriging and splines to carry out spatial interpolation of point measures of ozone obtained at 27 air quality monitoring stations to the locations of the houses. We take a spatial econometric perspective and employ both maximum-likelihood and general method of moments techniques in the estimation of the hedonic. A high degree of residual spatial autocorrelation warrants the inclusion of a spatially lagged dependent variable in the regression model. We find significant differences across interpolators in the coefficients of ozone, as well as in the estimates of willingness to pay. Overall, the Kriging technique provides the best results in terms of estimates (signs), model fit and interpretation. There is some indication that the use of a categorical measure for ozone is superior to a continuous one. © 2006 Regional Studies Association.},

We show that multinational firms are able to shift profits abroad even if they fully comply with the tax code. This is because, in equilibrium, intra-firm transactions occur in firms that are better than the market at input production. Moreover, market input prices include a mark-up that arises from the bargaining between the firm and the independent supplier. Transfer prices set at market values following the arm's length principle thus systematically exceed multinationals' marginal costs, leading to a reduction of tax payments for each unit sold. The optimal organization of firms hence provides a new rationale for the empirically observed lower tax burden of multinational corporations. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We investigate how tax rates, and the interaction between corruption and tax rates, influence variations in entry across a panel of 72 countries in the period 2005–2011. We use a series of panel estimations as well as several robustness checks to test these effects, using relevant controls for economic development, the size of the state, and other regulatory and tax policy measures. We find that higher tax rates consistently discourage entry. Further, we find that although the direct influence of corruption on entry is also consistently negative, the interaction influence of corruption and tax rate is positive. This indicates that corruption can offset the negative influence of high taxes on entry. We discuss the implications of our findings for policymakers and future research.},

We find that e-invoicing increases reported firm sales, purchases and VAT liabilities by over 5 percent in the first year after adoption. The impact is concentrated among small firms and sectors with higher rates of non-compliance, suggesting that e-invoicing enhances compliance by lowering compliance costs and strengthening deterrence. However, we also find that existing stocks of VAT credits were used to offset the reform's positive effects on VAT collection, suggesting that digital tools such as e-invoicing would need to be complemented by other reforms to improve revenue mobilization.},

Abstract: This paper uses firm-level data for Mexican exporters to understand how firm-level export decisions shape a country's aggregate exports. The data allows for a characterization of both the cross-sectional distribution of Mexican exports, across destinations and across exporting firms, and of the time-series variation in aggregate exports and its relation to time-series variation in the export supply decisions of firms. It is found that the cross-sectional variation of exports is mostly accounted for the extensive margins of trade, particularly the extensive margin of number of products exported, while the time-series variation in aggregate exports is mostly accounted for by the intensive margin of trade, and in particular by the growth of exporting firms that retain their export status from year to year. Resumen: Este documento utiliza datos a nivel empresa de exportadores mexicanos para entender cómo las decisiones de exportación de las empresas determinan las exportaciones agregadas del país. Los datos permiten una caracterización de tanto la distribución transversal de las exportaciones mexicanas, a través de destinos y a través de empresas exportadores, así como de la variación en el tiempo de las exportaciones agregadas y su relación con la variación en el tiempo de las decisiones de exportación de las empresas. Se encuentra que la variación transversal en las exportaciones se explica principalmente por el margen extensivo del comercio, en particular por el margen extensivo del número de productos exportados, mientras que la variación en el tiempo de las exportaciones agregadas se explica principalmente por el margen intensivo del comercio, en particular por el crecimiento de aquellas empresas que mantienen su estatus exportador año tras año.

We offer aformal model of corporate income tax evasion. While individual tax evasion is essentially a portfolio-selection problem, corporate income tax evasion is much more complicated. When the owner of a firm decides to evade taxes, not only does she risk being detected by the tax authorities, more importantly, the optimal compensation scheme offered to the employees will also be altered. Specifically, due to the illegal nature of tax evasion, the contract offered to the manager is necessarily incomplete. This creates a distortion in the manager's effort and reduces the efficiency of the contract. Tax evasion thus increases the profit retained by the firm not only at the risk of being detected, but also at the cost of efficiency loss in internal control.},

We introduce an identification scheme and an estimation procedure that jointly deals with measurement error in capital and the standard simultaneity bias due to unobserved productivity shocks. We use lagged investment to instrument for potentially mis-measured capital stock, while conditioning on the part of productivity that is persistent. Our estimation routine nests standard approaches in the literature, such as Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015). It requires no additional data as investment is usually collected with other producer level data. We show through Monte-Carlo experiments that a 40 percent measurement error in capital yields capital coefficients that are biased downward by a factor of two. We illustrate our approach using data for three distinct economies: China, India and Chile; which experienced radically different processes of capital and productivity dynamics. We find capital coefficients that are typically two times larger than those using standard approaches that only control for simultaneity.},

Earlier work has examined the determinants of the size of the informal sector, focusing separately on factors such as tax and regulation burden, financial market development, and the quality of the legal system. We revisit this issue by using an integrated data set which contains information on all these aspects. Building on a simple analytical framework, we test the channels affecting the degree of informality. We find that the quality of the legal framework is crucially important in determining the size of the informal sector, whereas the significance of taxes, regulations, and financial constraints is reduced in the context of a well functioning legal system, consistent with the presented model. Additionally, firm size is negatively correlated with the propensity to go informal; finance constraints tend to induce informality among smaller firms but not among large firms, whereas legal obstacles induce informality among larger firms. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Subjects face a tax rate that varies across rounds and are required to pay taxes on earned income. The treatment group is given the opportunity to underreport income, while the control group is not. We find evidence that participants in the treatment group respond differently to changes in the net-of-tax rate than participants in the control group. The effect is more prevalent when tax rates fall. Additionally, the direction of the treatment effect is dependent on the evolution of tax rates across rounds. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Moreover, firms that borrow from formal or informal sources and those that pay taxes are significantly more likely to stay in business but firms that received credit exhibit lower rates of income growth. These results persist when firm characteristics that are arguably correlated with unobserved entrepreneurial ability are controlled for. Our findings suggest that the significant within-country differences in firm productivity observed in developing economies are due in part to market and government failures that limit the ability of micro-firms to reach their optimal sizes. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {The paper shows a key role of human capital in explaining how US postwar growth and welfare could have increased while tax rates declined. As in evidence, we assume that the share of government revenue in output has remained stable and model tax evasion within an endogenous growth model with human capital. A trend upwards in the productivity of the goods or human capital sectors gradually decreases the degree of tax evasion, and causes a trend upwards in time spent in human capital accumulation. These productivity increases also increase the ratio of tax revenue to GDP at any given tax rate such that the tax rate must be reduced in order to be consistent with the stylized fact of a constant share of government revenue in output. Based on estimated US postwar goods and human capital sectoral productivities, the model explains 30% of the actual decline in a weighted average of postwar US top marginal personal and corporate tax rates. The estimated joint sectoral productivity increases are asymmetric with a larger relative increase in the human capital investment sector, a result related to McGrattan and Prescott's (2010) relatively larger increase in the productivity of the sector producing intangible capital relative to the goods sector. We show that in a special case of exogenous growth without human capital investment, the explanatory power of the tax trend drops signi…cantly. JEL Classi…cation: E13, E62, H26, O41},

Measurement error models describe mappings from a latent distribution to an observed distribution. The identification and estimation of measurement error models focus on how to obtain the latent distribution and the measurement error distribution from the observed distribution. Such a framework is suitable for many microeconomic models with latent variables, such as models with unobserved heterogeneity or unobserved state variables and panel data models with fixed effects. Recent developments in measurement error models allow very flexible specification of the latent distribution and the measurement error distribution. These developments greatly broaden economic applications of measurement error models.

I develop a general equilibrium model where heterogeneous establishments optimally select themselves into informality, tax compliance, and formal tax evasion. Informal firms evade taxes by staying small, while larger, formal firms can engage in costly tax evasion. In equilibrium, tax revenues rely on medium-sized firms, which are scarce. In a calibration exercise using data from Mexico, I find that reducing the returns to tax evasion by formal firms increases tax revenues by up to 68%. However, economies where such returns are too high face a trade-off between tax collection and aggregate efficiency, as cracking down on formal tax-evading firms pushes some firms into informality. Last, as the economy develops, the informal sector shrinks, while the tax-evading sector expands, thus limiting potential collection. If lower informality is a byproduct of development, and not vice versa, a solid tax base can be achieved by fiscal authorities effectively by focusing on formal tax evasion.},

Abstract There is a sizeable overall tax gap in the U.S., albeit tax noncompliance differs sharply across income types. While only small percentages of wages and salaries are underreported, the estimated misreporting rate of self-employment business income is substantial. This paper studies how tax evasion in the self-employment sector affects aggregate outcomes and inequality. To this end, we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model with incomplete markets in which heterogeneous agents choose between being a worker and being self-employed. Self-employed agents may hide a share of their business income but are confronted with the probability of being detected by the tax authority. Our model replicates important quantitative features of U.S. data, in particular, the misreporting rate, wealth inequality, and the firm size distribution. Our quantitative findings suggest that tax evasion induces self-employed businesses to stay small. In the aggregate, tax evasion increases the size but decreases the productivity of the self-employment sector. Moreover, it increases aggregate savings and reduces wealth inequality. We show that tax revenues follow a Laffer curve in the size of the tax evasion penalty. JEL Classifications: H24, H25, H26, C63, E62, E65.},

   abstract = {We evaluate the relative importance of labor productivity versus income taxes and social contributions for tax compliance in an economy with a large degree of informality. Empirical evidence points out that tax evasion in Europe happens through partially concealing wages and profits in formally registered enterprises. To this end, we build a model in which employer-employee pairs of heterogeneous productive capacities make joint decisions on the degree of tax evasion. The quantitative model takes as inputs the income tax structure and social contributions. The model is used to analyze the case of Bulgaria which has the largest informal economy in Europe. The estimation strategy relies on matching the empirical series for the size of the informal economy and other aggregate outcomes for 2000-2014. Our counterfactual experiments show that the most important factor for the changing size of the informal economy is labor productivity, which accounts for more than 75% of the change. The variation in corporate income tax accounts for the rest. Changes in personal income tax levels and progressivity are found not to be quantitatively relevant for tax evasion. We also characterize optimal taxation in 2014 with respect to minimizing tax evasion. The productive gains of imposing optimal taxes are small. JEL Classifications: H24, H25, H26, C63, E62, E65.},

To examine the weak association between structural change and productivity growth, two features are studiedinter- and intra-industry transformations, and the contribution of production factors to value added growth. The paper shows that despite a significant reallocation of hours worked across industries, its aggregate impact has been hindered by the prevalence of flows from sectors with high labor productivity growth towards those with lower or declining productivity growth. In addition, highly qualified production factors (both labor and capital) have not showed a significant contribution to value added growth.},

Abstract: This paper applies a structural framework to estimate production function coefficients, obtain firm-level markup estimates, and evaluate the impact of the trade liberalization that took place in Mexico in the period 1984-1990 on the profitability of the firms operating in the domestic market and exporters. Quantitatively, the results show no evidence of substantial productivity growth, but some evidence of trade discipline on the price-cost margins. A markup premium is however identified for intensive exporters. Qualitatively, these results suggest that the effectiveness of trade policies crucially depends on adequately implementing complementary reforms aimed at improving the competitiveness and the efficiency in the allocation of resources in the internal market. Resumen: En este documento, se aplica un marco estructural para estimar los coeficientes de la función de producción, se obtienen estimaciones de márgenes precio-costo (markups) a nivel empresa y se evalúa el impacto de la liberalización comercial que ocurrió en México en el periodo 1984-1990 sobre la rentabilidad de las empresas que operan en el mercado nacional y la de los exportadores. Cuantitativamente, los resultados no muestran evidencia de un crecimiento sustancial de la productividad, pero sí cierta evidencia de la presencia de disciplina comercial en los márgenes de rentabilidad. Sin embargo, se observa una prima sobre los markups para los exportadores intensivos. Cualitativamente, estos resultados sugieren que la efectividad de las políticas comerciales depende fundamentalmente de la implementación adecuada de reformas complementarias que mejoren la competencia y la eficiencia en la asignación de los recursos en el mercado interno.

It reviews the comparative statics of the original model of individual behavior where the tax evasion decision is analogous to portfolio choice, and its extensions to incorporate socially conscious behavior, participation in the black labor market and tax evasion by firms. It also discusses the analysis of tax incidence and the problems involved in moving from individual to aggregate analysis. Finally, it reviews the issues that arise in formulating models of optimal taxation in the presence of tax evasion.},

   abstract = {Economic models often depend on quantities that are unobservable, either for privacy reasons or because they are difficult to measure. Examples of such variables include human capital (or ability), personal income, unobserved het-erogeneity (such as consumer "types"), etc. This situation has historically been handled either by simply using observable imperfect proxies for each the unob-servables, or by assuming that such unobservables satisfy convenient conditional mean or independence assumptions that enable their elimination from the estimation problem. However, thanks to tremendous increases in both the amount of data available and computing power, it has become possible to take full advantage of recent formal methods to infer the statistical properties of unobservable variables from multiple imperfect measurements of them. The general framework used is the concept of measurement systems in which a vector of observed variables is expressed as a (possibly nonlinear or nonparamet-ric) function of a vector of all unobserved variables (including unobserved error terms or "disturbances" that may have non additively separable affects). The framework emphasizes important connections with related fields, such as non-linear panel data, limited dependent variables, game theoretic models, dynamic models and set-identification. This review reports the progress made towards the central question of whether there exist plausible assumptions under which one can identify the joint distribution of the unobservables from the knowledge of the joint distribution of the observables. It also overviews empirical efforts aimed at exploiting such identification results to deliver novel findings that formally account for the unavoidable presence of unobservables.},

@article{Slemrod2002,
   abstract = {Tax avoidance and evasion are pervasive in all countries, and tax structures are undoubtedly skewed by this reality. Standard models of taxation and their conclusions must reflect these realities. This paper first presents theoretical models that integrate avoidance and evasion into the overall decision problem faced by individuals. Early models of this area focused on tax evasion, modeled as a gamble against the enforcement capability of the state. More recently, the literature has examined more general models of the technology of avoidance, with the additional risk bearing caused by tax evasion either being a special case of this technology or one aspect of the cost of changing behavior to reduce tax liability. If the cost of evasion and avoidance depends on other aspects of behavior, the choice of consumption basket and avoidance become intertwined. The paper then relates the behavior predicted by the model to what is known empirically about the extent of evasion and avoidance, and how it responds to tax enforcement policy. The paper then turns to normative analysis, and discusses how avoidance and evasion affect the analysis of vertical and horizontal equity as well as efficiency costs; a taxonomy of efficiency costs is presented. Acknowledging the variety of behavioral responses to taxation changes the answers to traditional subjects of inquiry, such as incidence, optimal progressivity, and the optimal mix between income and consumption taxes. It also raises a whole new set of policy questions, such as the appropriate level of resources to devote to administration and enforcement, and how those resources should be deployed. Because there are a variety of policy instruments that can affect the magnitude and nature of avoidance and evasion response, the elasticity of behavioral response is itself a policy instrument, to be chosen optimally. The paper reviews that is known about these issues, and introduces a general theory of optimal tax systems, in which tax rates and bases are chosen simultaneously with the administrative and enforcement regimes. We argue that the concept of the marginal efficiency cost of funds is a useful way to summarize the normative issues that arise, and expand the concept to include administrative costs, avoidance, and evasion. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.},

   abstract = {This paper studies the implications of tax evasion for the optimal design of central bank digital currency (CBDC). I build a general equilibrium framework to explicitly allow tax evasion by agents and tax audits by a government. I find that as long as CBDC offers less anonymity than cash, introducing CBDC will decrease tax evasion. However, if CBDC is "cash-like" in the sense that it still offers relatively high level of anonymity but low interest rate, then introducing CBDC will decrease the output from not only agents who evade taxes but also agents who report their income truthfully. If CBDC is instead "deposit-like" in the sense that it offers low anonymity but high interest rate, then introducing CBDC will increase output and aggregate welfare. Furthermore, introducing deposit-like CBDC needs not increase the funding costs of private banks or decrease bank lending and investment. However, paying a high interest rate on CBDC will decrease the central bank's net interest revenue, which may jeopardize the central bank's independence.},

   abstract = {Mexico has kept electronic records of all taxable transactions since 2014. Anonymized data collected by the Mexican federal government comprises more than 80 million contributors (individuals and companies) and almost 7 billion monthly-aggregations of invoices among contributors between January 2015 and December 2018. This data includes a list of almost ten thousand contributors already identified as tax evaders, due to their activities fabricating invoices for non-existing products or services so that recipients can evade taxes. Harnessing this extensive dataset, we build monthly and yearly temporal networks where nodes are contributors and directed links are invoices produced in a given time slice. Exploring the properties of the network neighborhoods around tax evaders, we show that their interaction patterns differ from those of the majority of contributors. In particular, invoicing loops between tax evaders and their clients are over-represented. With this insight, we use two machine-learning methods to classify other contributors as suspects of tax evasion: deep neural networks and random forests. We train each method with a portion of the tax evader list and test it with the rest, obtaining more than 0.9 accuracy with both methods. By using the complete dataset of contributors, each method classifies more than 100 thousand suspects of tax evasion, with more than 40 thousand suspects classified by both methods. We further reduce the number of suspects by focusing on those with a short network distance from known tax evaders. We thus obtain a list of highly suspicious contributors sorted by the amount of evaded tax, valuable information for the authorities to further investigate illegal tax activity in Mexico. With our methods, we estimate previously undetected tax evasion in the order of \$10 billion USD per year by about 10 thousand contributors.},

We show connections to the familiar spline penalty on the integral of the squared second derivative. A short overview of B-splines, of their construction and of penalized likelihood is presented. We discuss properties of penalized B-splines and propose various criteria for the choice of an optimal penalty parameter.
