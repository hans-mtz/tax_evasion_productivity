## Colombia 1981-1991

### Colombian Corporate Tax System

The relevant corporate taxes for input overreporting are the Corporate Income Tax and the Sales Tax. The Sales gradually transformed into a kind of Value-Added Tax.

High levels of overall tax evasion during the period. No penalties, an inefficient monitoring system, overburdened authority, and legal loopholes.

#### Corporate Income tax

The Corporate Income Tax depended on the type of juridical organization of the firm. For tax purposes, we can classify firms as Corporations, Partnerships, Limited Liability Companies, and Individual Proprietorships. 

Corporations were taxed at a fixed rate of 40%, while Partnerships and Limited Liability companies at 20%. Individual proprietors were subject to the graduated Individual Tax Schedule consisting of 56 rates, ranging from 0.50 to 51 percent. 

Corporations were taxed on their distributed dividends, while partnerships and limited liability companies were taxed on their profits, whether or not distributed. Owners of juridical organizations were double taxed, at the firm and the individual level, whereas the income of proprietorships was taxed only once. 

Moreover, Corporations were subject to the Superintendent of Corporations and were closely supervised, being required to have an auditor.

Since 1974, individuals and juridical organizations, except for limited liability companies, were subject to the minimum presumptive income. Rent (income and profits) was presumed to be no less than 8 percent of net wealth (assets less depreciation, real estate, livestock, securities). Firms with profits lower than 8 percent of their wealth had incentives to underreport capital. Firms with larger profits had incentives to overreport inputs and underreport sales.

Exemptions were granted for automobile producers, private electrical companies, airlines, publishing, and reforestation sectors, and various activities in selected regions (primarily "frontier" and other less developed ones).

#### Sales taxes

Sales taxes were originally targeted at the manufacturing sector on finished goods and imports. Since 1974, manufacturers were allowed to credit taxes paid on any purchase made by the firm, except the acquisition of capital goods [@Perry1990]. The credits worked through a system of refunds. Consequently, the tax became a kind of value-added tax (VAT). The VAT was extended to many services. 

The basic rate was 15 percent. There was also a preferential rate of 6 percent for "wage goods" (clothing, footwear, and major inputs used for building popular housing), and a rate of 35 percent for luxury goods. Exports, foodstuff, drugs, and textbooks were excluded from the beginning. Also excluded were inputs, transportation equipment, agricultural machinery, and equipment.

#### Take-aways

- Corporations are the least likely to evade because the probability of detection is higher for them.
- Firms' incentives to overreport inputs were heterogeneous within industry sectors because it depended on the effective sales tax rate which varied according to the firm's location and sales composition (inputs to other firms, to consumers, to the foreign market), and the type of juridical organization.
- Individual proprietorships (and maybe low revenue limited liability companies) were likely to bunch at the individual income thresholds.


### Fiscal Reforms

During this period, Colombia went through three major fiscal reforms (1983, 1986, 1990). 

#### 1983

The 1983 reform tried to alleviate the double taxation by introducing a tax credit of 10% of dividends received for individuals.

In addition, Law 9 of 1983 instituted a measure of presumptive income equal to 2 percent of gross receipts to supplement the measure based on net wealth. This reform was aimed specifically at the commerce and service sectors; the former was thought to evade the wealth-based presumptive tax by systematically understating inventories. In addition, it extended the presumptive income tax to limited liability companies.

In 1983, the value-added tax (VAT) was extended to the retail level, with a *simplified system* being made available to small retailers to ease compliance costs and the administrative burden.

The 1983 reform relatively unified the value-added tax (VAT) rates by combining previously taxed goods at 6% and 15 percent into 10%. The number of the products and services that were levied expanded. 

In 1984, exemptions for agricultural machinery, transportation equipment, and certain other goods were eliminated.


#### 1986

The 1986 reforms unified the taxation of corporations and limited liability companies by taxing both at a rate of 30%. The top tax rate applied to individual income was reduced from 49 to 30%.

Double taxation was eliminated. The reform exempted corporate dividends and participation in profits of limited liability companies from tax at the individual shareholder/owner level. 

Lastly, the 1986 reform relocated the tax collection and reception of tax reports to the banking system, among other things. 

#### 1990

The 1990 reform increased the VAT from 10% to 12%. See section the appendix for more details on the fiscal reforms.

Intuitively, we expect higher levels of tax evasion if tax rates increase. On the other hand, reporting more information to the authority —like the firms required to report and pay profit taxes in 1983—, or having a third party reporting on your private information — like the banking system being responsible for the collection and reception of tax reports in 1986— would decrease tax evasion.
