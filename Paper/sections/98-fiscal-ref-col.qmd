## Fiscal Reforms in Colombia 1981-1991

During this period, Colombia went through three major fiscal reforms (1983, 1986, 1990). 

#### 1983

The 1983 reform tried to alleviate double taxation by introducing a tax credit of 10% of dividends received by shareholders of corporations.

In addition, Law 9 of 1983 instituted a new measure of presumptive income equal to 2 percent of gross receipts to supplement the measure based on net wealth. This reform was aimed specifically at the commerce and service sectors; the former was thought to evade the wealth-based presumptive tax by systematically understating inventories. Under the original presumptive income, a juridical entity cannot declare income less than 8% of its capital (wealth).

In addition, the 1983 reform extended the presumptive income tax to limited liability companies. Before this reform, all juridical organizations were subject to the presumptive income tax except for limited liability companies. 

In 1983, the value-added tax (VAT) was extended to the retail level, with a *simplified system* being made available to small retailers to ease compliance costs and the administrative burden.

The 1983 reform relatively unified the value-added tax (VAT) rates by combining previously taxed goods at 6% and 15 percent into 10%. The number of the products and services that were levied expanded. 

In 1984, VAT exemptions for agricultural machinery, transportation equipment, and certain other goods were eliminated.


#### 1986

The 1986 reforms unified the taxation of corporations and limited liability companies by taxing both at a rate of 30%. The top tax rate applied to individual income was reduced from 49 to 30%.

Double taxation was eliminated. The reform exempted corporate dividends and participation in profits of limited liability companies from tax at the individual shareholder/owner level. 

Lastly, the 1986 reform relocated the tax collection and reception of tax reports to the banking system, among other things. 

#### 1990

The 1990 reform increased the VAT from 10% to 12%. 

In addition, the individual income obtained from the sale of shares through the stock market was exempted from taxation. Income tax was waived for investment funds, mutual funds, and securities, and the rates for remittances and income for foreign investment were reduced. Tax amnesties were granted, and the sanitation tax was reduced to encourage the repatriation of capital.


#### Discussion

Increases in the VAT would increase the incentives to evade. Decreases in CIT would decrease them. Intuitively, we expect higher levels of tax evasion if tax rates increase.

The CIT homogenization between Corporations and LLCs in 1986 would have motivated LLCs to incorporate. Likewise, the elimination of double taxation also in 1986 would have motivated proprietorships to become LLCs, Corporations, or Partnerships.

On the other hand, reporting more information to the tax authority — like the banking system being responsible for the collection and reception of tax reports in 1986— would decrease tax evasion.

### The Fiscal Reforms and the Data

A simple graphical analysis shows that the average (of the log) intermediates cost share of sales started growing after 1983 and that it stabilized in 1988 after the policy changes of the 1986 reform settled in (@fig-logshare). The dataset does not capture any changes after the 1990 reform, although there is only one more year of data.

![Input's cost share of sales, average by year of the logs.](../Results/Figures/Colombia/log_share_byy.png){#fig-logshare fig-align="center" width="100%"}

As a validation exercise, we can see that the VAT changes induced by the three fiscal reforms are captured in the dataset. @fig-vat shows that the sales tax increased to 10% after the 1983 reform, and then around 12% after the 1990 reform.

![Sale taxes paid as share of sales, average by year.](../Results/Figures/Colombia/share_sales_tax_byy.png){#fig-vat fig-align="center" width="100%"}

Just as an exercise to see if other economic changes in this period were driving the apparent changes in overreporting, @fig-logsales shows that sales, for instance, were not exactly following the changes in fiscal policy. Sales started to grow during 1983, the year of the reform, whereas the cost share of sales started to grow the year after. Likewise, sales fell in 1986, while the cost share seems to reduce its growth after 1986.

Finally, in a preliminary empirical assessment, I observe that the sales tax rate is a significant determinant of the log share of revenue and that non-corporations consistently use 13-17 percent more intermediates than Corporations for a rich set of controls [@tbl-reg-jo-tax]. The results were estimated following @eq-reg-tax-jo

$$
log(s_{it})= \alpha_1Tax_{it}+\beta_1'JurOrg_i + \beta_2'JurOrg_i\times\gamma_t+ \gamma_t + \gamma_{ind} +\gamma_{metro} + \beta_3'Z+ \varepsilon_{it}

```

Effect of the Juridical Organization Type and Sales Tax on the Log Share of Intermediate Inputs.

:::

Although this is not deterministic evidence, it does not contradict the hypothesis that firms other than corporations have incentives to overreport intermediates to evade taxes and that the higher the taxes the higher the incentives to evade by misreporting.
