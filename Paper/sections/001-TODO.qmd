## TODO {-}

- Correct tests: 
  - Use corps to get beta, test on non-corps
  - Use corps to get beta, test on all
  - Bootstrap all (Use bayesian bootstrap)
- Why are there true negatives?
  - Only two industries: 323 Leather and Leather Products and 356 Plastic Products
- Other Data: Ecuador, (Spain?)
- Summarize main points of Lit in Slides


## Updates {-}

  - CD
    - Preliminary results of Tax Evasion: Moments, MLE (Truncated Normal and LogNormal)

    - **New** Discussion: Variance of the error term and Choosing intermediates in GNR-CD.
    - **New** Preliminary results of PF parameters
    - **New** Productivity results

  - TransLog
