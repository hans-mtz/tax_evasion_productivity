## Notes

### Next steps

- Estimate parametric deconvolution for Colombian data. Use industries that paid the least taxes in 1981?
- Model: polish with comments from Javier and Chong
- Model: Add the continuous case
- Model: send to Rory for feedback
- Check if Colombian data match predictions from the model about the distribution of the firm's income
- Check out Chilenean data:
    - What's k, l, m?
    - What information is there about taxes?
