## Intermediate Inputs

What are intermediate inputs? Intermediate inputs are flexible and in our case firms should have incentives to overreport them. Raw materials, electricity, fuels, and services are what researchers have in mind when they refer to intermediates. In the context of tax evasion in Colombia, materials are the input of interest for several reasons.

First, firms have incentives to overreport production expenses to evade CIT, but only VAT deductible intermediates reduce their VAT burden. In fact, Colombia used system of refunds to companies with VAT tax balances in their favor. Raw materials are VAT deductible during the whole period of out data, 1981-1991. In addition, materials are the greater share of the firm's expenses among the other intermediate inputs. 

Electricity was mainly provided by government companies during this period. Even though there were private participation in the market, the data shows that corportaions sold most of the private electricity. In our paper, we argue that Corporations are the firms with the lowest incentives to misreport their commercial activity. Therefore, it could have been relatively riskier to fake an electric bill than other inputs. Why? Because any electricity bill not coming from a Corporation or a Government company might look suspicious. In addition, it is unclear that firms could deduct from their taxes their electric bill. Finally, electricity is a small share of the firm's expenses in the data.

Fuels consumed in production were deductible however these represent a non significant share of the firms' expenses.

Finally, only repair and maintenance services were taxed from the begining during this period. The authority gradually introduced services they could control easily like telephone and telecommunication, insurances, airline tiquets, and parking, among others. The rest of the services look more like fixed costs and not like intermediate inputs for production, or at least they do not necessarily increase with production. Take for instance, telephone bills. They might increase if an increase of output comes from handling more clients, but they might keep the same and production might increase if current clients increase their volume of demanded products.

## Industries

Given that I'll focus on materials, the industries I pick would have to make sense. Meaning, that firms should have nontrivial incentives to overreport raw materials to evade taxes and raw materials should represent a nontrivial share of their total production expenses.

To start, unprocessed primary goods such as mining, agricultural, fishing, and forestry were exempt of sales taxes. If the main raw materials of an industry is a primary good, then firms in that industry would have no invcentive to overreport their raw materials because they are not paying sales taxes on their raw material that could be credited towards the taxes they have to pay for their sales. Industries like concrete and clay used in construction (369-Non-Metallic Minerals) and leather products (323-Leather tanning and dyeing, Furskins) might fall into this category.

For other industries, few specialized suppliers provide their main raw materials. These firms might have to import a non-trivial share of their materials. It would be highly suspicious to fake invoices of raw materials that come from few known local and international suppliers. For example, plastic pellets the main raw material in injection molding and plastic products (356) are supplied internationally by a handful of suppliers located in the US and Europe. 

Finally, industries exempt of sales tax would have relative lower incentives to evade than non-exempt. In Colombia, firms producing foodstuffs (311 and 312), drugs, textbooks, transportation equipment (384), agricultural machinery (382-Non-Electrical Machinery incluiding Farm Machinery), and equipment (383-Electrical Equipment) were exempt of sales taxes since 1974. Exemption to Agricultural machinery and transportation equipment was eliminated in 1984. Almost half-way through the data.

(In addition, exporters were exempted from sales taxes. )
