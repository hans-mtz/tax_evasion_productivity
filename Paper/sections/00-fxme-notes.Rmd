\subsection{Prospectus Objective}

Demonstrate that:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Clear and original question
 \item The question is interesting (it addresses a nontrivial problem) and important (it's of interest to scholars in the student's field)
 \item Feasible solution and within student's reach during the remainder of Ph.D.
 \item Resulting research is publishable in a good field journal
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{RAP}

RAP0

A: Tax evasion through cost overreporting biases production function parameters and firm-level productivity estimates. In addition, tax evasion reshuffles firms in the distribution of productivity. Likewise, ignoring firm-level productivity might lead to biased estimates of tax evasion.

R: What's the effect of tax evasion through cost overreporting on the production function and productivity estimates? What's the result of ignoring productivity when estimating tax evasion?

P: Even though tax evasion is widespread, it has not been satisfactorily addressed in the estimation of production functions and productivity, on one hand. On the other, firm-level productivity has not been actively considered when measuring tax evasion by firms.

RAP1

A: Firm-level productivity estimates using gross-production functions are downward biased when firms over-report expenses of the flexible input to reduce their tax obligations and increase their profits. 

R: Are our firm-level productivity estimates downward biased because of firms' tax evasion?

P: Although tax evasion is a widespread phenomenon, it has been ignored in the estimation of firm-level productivity.

RAP2

A: Firm-level productivity estimates using gross-production functions are less spread out when accounting for systematic under-reporting of expenses in the flexible input to evade taxes.

R: Does accounting for the firm's tax evasion help us explain the great variation of firm-level productivity estimates?

P: Tax evasion has been ignored as a possible cause for the wide variation of productivity across firms.

RAP3

A: Low productivity firms in Mexico are not as low as believed.

R: Why are low-productivity firms in Mexico surviving in the market?

P: This paper is the first to consider tax evasion as a possible explanation for the productivity puzzle in Mexico, i.e., why are low-productivity firms surviving in the market?

RAP4

A: I provide a novel strategy to estimate tax evasion through cost overreporting using commonly available data. I show that ignoring tax evasion leads to biased estimates of firm-level productivity. Finally, I show how to recover productivity in the presence of cost overreporting.

R: How can a researcher estimate tax evasion with commonly available data like manufacturing surveys? What's the effect of this strategy of tax evasion on our productivity measures?

P: Detecting and measuring tax evasion remains a challenge even for governments with detailed administrative data. Moreover, if cost-overreporting tax evasion is quantitatively large and widespread, then firm-level productivity estimates are likely to be biased.
